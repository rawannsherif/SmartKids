		<h3>Question 5: What happens if I am delayed collecting my child??</h3>
			<div class="content1">
				<div class="content-inner">
					<p>Sometimes parents are unavoidably delayed.  Please let us know as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary concerns.  Arrangements will be made to look after your child until you arrive.  In the event that you are more than 15 minutes late, we will have to make an additional charge to cover staff costs..</p>

	<h3>Question 6: Will my child be required to bring anything with them when starting nursery?</h3>
			<div class="content1">
				<div class="content-inner">
					<p>Yes â€“ generally parents send their child to nursery with a bag each day with the relevant items listed below.  However, we can store nappies, wet wipes, nappy cream and a spare change of clothes in their individual box or bag at nursery.  Please consider weather conditions when providing your child with clothes for the day to ensure your child can join in with outside play even in the winter months.  In hot weather children will need a suitable sun hat and we ensure children are protected with suncream.</p>
